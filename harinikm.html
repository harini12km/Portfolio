            <h2>Virtual assistance using AI</h2>
            <p>This paper presents an AI-powered virtual assistant with advanced features designed to enhance user engagement and service quality. Key improvements include voice recording capabilities, allowing users to take notes or record verbal messages directly. The assistant integrates location-based services, offering tailored assistance based on the userâ€™s latitude and longitude. Gesture-based communication, such as sign language, is supported, improving accessibility for users with specific needs. A choice-limit representation feature provides transparency, allowing users to understand AI-driven decisions. These enhancements aim to create a more inclusive and user-friendly virtual assistant.</p>

            <p>The Safe screen feature, a default option in mobile settings, is designed to regulate and enhance device usage safety, particularly for younger users. Utilizing the front-facing camera, safe screen leverages facial recognition technology to accurately determine the user's age. This innovative capability allows the system to categorize users by age groups and tailor the device experience accordingly. Safe screen is automatically activated during device setup or upon first use. When a user within this age range is detected, the system initiates a prompt for setting a predetermined usage time limit. Users can choose from predefined intervals, such as 5 or 10 minutes, to manage their sessions effectively.</p>

            <h2>Energy consumption visualization</h2>
            <p>Energy visualization tools using AR enhance building energy efficiency by overlaying live data onto physical environments, providing insights into inefficiencies for proactive management. Facility managers benefit from simplified monitoring and decision-making through intuitive workflows. AR can highlight energy hotspots and offer prescriptive advice for resource allocation, reducing waste. Integration with building management systems (BMS) supports data-driven decisions, leading to significant energy conservation and carbon reduction. While challenges like high costs and data standards exist, the rapid development of AR technology fosters widespread adoption. Ultimately, AR tools promote energy efficiency and sustainable building operations.</p>
